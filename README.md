# Metting Room
This problem simulates a business meeting room that holds no more than five people male or female at the same time. The code should run for two minutes and twenty people should be created, one every 2 seconds. The goal of the problem is to get people in the room to exchange business cards with each other. At the end of the program, a report should be generated informing the cards of each person who left the room, the time that each of them was inside the room, the average waiting time in the entry queue and the average time spent in the room.
